        <h2>OUR JOURNEY</h2>
        <p>We’ve turned the wheel full circle at Organic Tattva, by building a culture that thrives on the principles of
            health, ecology, fairness and care. From nurturing our soil and crops with unadulterated nourishment to
            testing each product for 186 pesticides, we follow the highest standards of quality and hygiene.
            The word "organic" means the way farmers grow and process farming (agricultural) products. These products
            include fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products such as milk and cheese, and meat. Organic farming
            practices are designed to meet the following goals: Improve soil and water quality.Organic Farming
            Practices: The journey begins on organic farms where farmers adhere to strict organic standards. Organic
            farming practices prioritize soil health, biodiversity, and the avoidance of synthetic pesticides and
            fertilizers

            <p>“When tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers, therefore, are the founders of human civilization.”
                – Daniel Webster Our sustainable farming techniques benefit an entire community of organic farmers, from
                whom we source our healthy organic produce. These farmers, nearly 9000 of them, belong to diverse states
                like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Jammu & Kashmir, where they cultivate
                crops that are endemic to their geographies. This means, our produce can be traced back to precise
                regions, which in turn, reassures our customers of its purity. While we manage the operations of the
                farms that are spread across a total crop area 15,390 ha., we also empower our farmers with the know-how
                of organic farming. We invest in them, and train them to practice environmentally-friendly farming
                techniques and grow crops that meet world-class standards. We help them practice mindful transactions
                and consumption and assure them of fair market prices</p>
